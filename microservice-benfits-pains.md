研究了9个维度的微服务的收益和痛点


##  A  Componentization Via Services （通过服务进行组件化）

#### 收益
 1) Practice 1: Independence by Separation  
- (the benefit of componentization are the independence or the autonomy of microservices)
- (shorten the lead time of products in practice)

#### 痛点
  2)  Chaotic Independence
- (For instance, inappropriate boundary among services may decrease the testability, especially when the mi-croservices are over fine-grained)
- (increases the complexity of joint debugging among different versions)
- (the developers may face the requests of joint debugging from different developers at the same time. Some remote microservices are not always connectable in this process, which exacerbates the pain of testing)

 > All these problems may seriously influence the speed of debugging and the efficiency of developments…


## Organized Around Business Capabilities  (围绕业务能力组织)

#### 收益
1)  Organizational Transformation
- （reduces the dependency and the communication among teams, and consequently lowers the cost of management. ）

#### 痛点
2） Unguided Organizational Transformation
- （organizations in this study still achieve the transformation mainly based on experience，
The mismatching between the organization structure and the architecture may cause the low 
 efficiency of internal development or the massive communication among teams.  不当的组织转型可能会带来效率低下）

- （ lack the guide on how to do it， Most importantly, we need the approval of the decision makers… ）


 
##  Smart Endpoints and Dumb Pipes (智能端点和哑通道)

#### 收益
1）  Choosing Communication Protocol
-（Four main factors concerned by practitioners are the maturity of the technology's ecosystem (8/13), the activity of the community (8/13),
   the supporting documents (6/13), and technology stacks with previous experience (6/13)）
-（这个收益主要指框架选择很多，基于RESTful的 Spring Cloud, 基于RPC的Apache Dubbo, 他们提供了很多组件，）

#### 痛点
2） Complexity of API Management
- （the communications among mi-croservices is the complexity of the implementation and management of API）
 


##   Decentralized Governance （分散治理）

#### 收益
1） Controlling Technology Diversity (控制技术多样性)
- (microservices support a mix of multiple languages, development frameworks and data-storage technologies, i.e. technology diversity
    但是从业者不会鼓励技术多样性，这会带来问题，如版本控制等)

 #### 痛点
 2） Excessive Technology Diversity
-（The diversity of technology stacks also raises the requirements on developers' ability and increases the complexity of the learning and construction.）


## Decentralized Data Management （分散数据管理）

#### 收益
 1） Compromise with Database Decomposition
     由于一下原因未考虑分解数据库：
- （Memory database in use）
- （Databases partitioned in legacy systems.）
- （Benefit analysis of decomposition）

#### 痛点

 2）Data Inconsistence
- （practitioners are usually pained with the complexity of addressing the distributed transactions while ensuring the data consistency.）
- （messaging-based or event-based, the design and implementation are very complicated）
- （The real process of addressing the data consistency is far more complicated than the description）



## Infrastructure Automation （基础设施自动化）

#### 收益
1） CI&CD
- （applying infrastructure automation technology）
- （service mesh technology to facilitate the upgrade and the version management of microservices. 通过Service Mesh 方便升级和管理）


#### 痛点
2） Inadequate Automation
- （many existing infrastructure-related technical frameworks are unsatisfying to meet their requirements. 许多基础设施不能满足现有的需求)


## Design for Failure 


#### 收益

1） Monitoring and Logging
- （Monitoring Metrics）
- （Monitoring Strategies）

#### 痛点

2) Unsatisfying Monitoring and Logging
- (Insufficiency of Automated Operation)
-  (Difficulty in Troubleshooting)
- (Difficulty in Threshold Setting)
-  (No Well-Rounded Monitoring System)


## Evolutionary Design (进化设计)

#### 收益
1） Stepwise Evolution

#### 痛点
2）  Missing of an Effective Decomposition Guide （缺少有效的分解指南）
- （DDD is a relatively abstract thing to us, without a specific process. Since different people had different consensus of views about it）

# 论文题目：GLOBAL MICROSERVICES TRENDS A SURVEY OF DEVELOPMENT PROFESSIONALS 


#### 收益：
1. By breaking applications down into lightweight and decoupled services that each serve a specific business need, development teams could deploy more frequently, scale more effectively, and avoid many of the problems of software monoliths.
2. Agility (82%) and scalability (78%) are the top motivators for microservices adoption 



#### 痛点：
1. 56% say each additional microservice increases operational challenges 
2. 73% find troubleshooting is harder in a microservices environment 
3. 98% of those that face issues identifying the root cause of issues in microservices environments report it has a direct business impact 
4. 87% of those in production report microservices generate more application data
